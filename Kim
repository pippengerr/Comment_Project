In the first semester, we covered the fundamentals of Python, including loops, conditionals, functions, and dictionaries. In addition, we explored connections between math and computer science, including plotting, simulating the game of craps, and optimizing customer service at a bank. 

In this semester, Kim has a quiz average of 65. For daily performance, she receives a score of 88. Her grade for the final exam is 80. Overall, her final grade for this semester is 79 (C). 

In Kim's reflection, she wrote: 'I'm trying really hard, but things just don't make sense all the time!' 

Her performance in our group project was acceptable. Kim could have done better with time management, but the overall effort was strong. 

Kim is very hardworking and easily bored. I enjoy having you in class. Meet with me during office hours before tests. You have great protential. I believe that if we work together, you can graduate.
