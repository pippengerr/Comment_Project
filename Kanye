In the first semester, we covered the fundamentals of Python, including loops, conditionals, functions, and dictionaries. In addition, we explored connections between math and computer science, including plotting, simulating the game of craps, and optimizing customer service at a bank. 

In this semester, Kanye has a quiz average of 76. For daily performance, he receives a score of 30. His grade for the final exam is 45. Overall, his final grade for this semester is 46 (F). 

In Kanye's reflection, he wrote: 'I can't read. I don't know what's happening.' 

His performance in our group project was subpar. Kanye did not communicate well within the team, and contributed little to the end product. 

Kanye is very stupid and lazy. I hate having you in class. I don't want to see you next semester. I do not know what is going on. But you should really start to consider about your future course schedules for next semester
