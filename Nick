In the first semester, we covered the fundamentals of Python, including loops, conditionals, functions, and dictionaries. In addition, we explored connections between math and computer science, including plotting, simulating the game of craps, and optimizing customer service at a bank. 

In this semester, Nick has a quiz average of 75. For daily performance, he receives a score of 90. His grade for the final exam is 80. Overall, his final grade for this semester is 83 (B). 

In Nick's reflection, he wrote: 'I can easily get good grades because of my appearance. I don't care about anything else.' 

His performance in our group project was acceptable. Nick could have done better with time management, but the overall effort was strong. 

Nick is very confident and promising. I enjoy having you in class. Meet with me during office hours before tests. You have great protential. I believe that if we work together, you can graduate.
