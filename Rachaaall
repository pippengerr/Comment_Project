In the first semester, we covered the fundamentals of Python, including loops, conditionals, functions, and dictionaries. In addition, we explored connections between math and computer science, including plotting, simulating the game of craps, and optimizing customer service at a bank. 

In this semester, Rachaaall has a quiz average of 98. For daily performance, she receives a score of 98. Her grade for the final exam is 100. Overall, her final grade for this semester is 98 (A). 

In Rachaaall's reflection, she wrote: 'My parents force me to get a good grade, I do not like computer science.' 

Her performance in our group project was superb. Rachaaall carried the load of the work and put in a great effort. 

Rachaaall is very hardworking and nerdy. I like having you in class. Keep up the good work! I am pleased with your work this semester. You finished all the assignment on time. You were active in class discussions. You also had great performance in tests and quizes. I am proud of you. Keep it up!
