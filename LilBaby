In the first semester, we covered the fundamentals of Python, including loops, conditionals, functions, and dictionaries. In addition, we explored connections between math and computer science, including plotting, simulating the game of craps, and optimizing customer service at a bank. 

In this semester, LilBaby has a quiz average of 100. For daily performance, he receives a score of 55. His grade for the final exam is 100. Overall, his final grade for this semester is 79 (C). 

In LilBaby's reflection, he wrote: 'I hate showing up to class, but the tests are easy.' 

His performance in our group project was superb. LilBaby carried the load of the work and put in a great effort. 

LilBaby is very weird and confusing. I appreciate having you in class. Pay more attention to class. Do not be cocky about your exam grade and quiz averages. Daily performance is also an important part of your grade and this course.
